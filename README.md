### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Karmanya, I'm a machine learning engineer that created the first publically available UFC fight stats dataset [\(Kaggle\)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/calmdownkarm/ufcdataset). 

I graduated with my Master's Degree from The University of Pennsylvania, where I pushed the boundaries of Large Language Models by getting them to play Dungeons and Dragons, and explored the evolution of news narratives across publishers and time

Check out my latest projects - 
* A very rough first cut of a [dungeons and dragons battlemap creator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Learner/jax-diffuser-event-battlemaps/tree/main)

* [Fireball!](https://github.com/zhudotexe/FIREBALL): A dataset of game state information and player narrations from millions of games of dungeons and dragons, which got accepted to ACL 2023.

* A [ChatGPT plugin](https://github.com/CalmDownKarm/avrae-chatgpt-plugin) that lets users interact with Avrae (A dungeons and dragons discord bot) to get game state and then reason and lawyer over the dnd rules and gamestate.
